# pykx-feedstock
A conda-smithy repository for the pykx feedstock.

PyKX is a Python first interface to the worlds fastest time-series database kdb+ and it's underlying vector
programming language q. PyKX takes a Python first approach to integrating q/kdb+ with Python following 10+ years of
integrations between these two languages. Fundamentally it provides users with the ability to efficiently query and
analyze huge amounts of in-memory and on-disk time-series data.
